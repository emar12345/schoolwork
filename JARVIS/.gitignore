.flutter-plugins-dependencies
# This file is auto-generated by Flutter based on the current plugin dependencies in your project.
# The file is specific to your local development environment and can vary between different environments 
# or developer machines, depending on the installed plugin versions. Including it in version control can 
# lead to unnecessary merge conflicts and does not provide any benefits, as each developer's environment 
# will regenerate it based on the pubspec.yaml and pubspec.lock files, which should be versioned.
