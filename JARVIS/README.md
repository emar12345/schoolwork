## Introduction

# J.A.R.V.I.S
JARVIS is a Flutter-based phone app AI assistant designed to help people handle all their daily tasks like a human assistant, allowing them to focus more on important matters. The software may include, but is not limited to, summarizing and sending emails, assisting users in answering and making phone calls, and helping with the payment of utilities and insurance bills, among other tasks. Just as the name JARVIS suggests, we aim to make this software a comprehensive AI assistant like JARVIS in Iron Man, helping Tony Stark solve problems and manage daily activities.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Flutter SDK (Version: As per `pubspec.yaml` dependency, requires Flutter >=3.1.5 <4.0.0)
- Dart SDK (Version: Compatible with Flutter SDK version)
- Recommended Development Environment: Visual Studio Code

### Dependencies

The project uses the following main dependencies:

- `firebase_core: ^2.24.2`
- `cloud_firestore: ^4.14.0`
- `flutter: sdk`
- `cupertino_icons: ^1.0.2`

They will be downloaded in the 'Getting Started' Section. 

#### Optional Dependencies:
To modify the back-end database FlutterFire and Firebase CLI are required. To emulate an android phone Android Studio is required.
- FlutterFire: [FlutterFire Documentation](https://firebase.flutter.dev/docs/overview)
- Firebase CLI: [Firebase Command Line Interface Setup](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli)
- Android Studio: [Download Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio)


### Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/COSC481W-2024Winter/JARVIS.git
   cd JARVIS
   ```

2. **Setup Flutter Environment**
   - Ensure Flutter is installed and set up on your system. If not, follow the instructions on the [Flutter official website](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install). We recommend following the VSCode path.
   - Run `flutter doctor` to ensure your environment is ready for Flutter development.

3. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```
   This command installs all the necessary dependencies as defined in `pubspec.yaml`.

4. **Add google-services.json & GoogleService-Info.plist**
   - The project uses Firebase, ensure you have the ```google-services.json``` for Android and ```GoogleService-Info.plist``` for iOS in the appropriate directories. (You may need to acquire these files from a project administrator or set up Firebase for your own clone.)

6. **Open in VSCode**
   - Open the project folder in Visual Studio Code.
   - Ensure the Flutter and Dart extensions are installed in VSCode for the best development experience.

### Preferred Method of running the App

1. **Start an Emulator or Connect a Device**
   - Open your preferred emulator or connect a physical device to your computer.

2. **Run the App**
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```
   This command compiles the app and launches it on the connected device or emulator. 

### Secondary Method of running the App

- **Web**: To run the app in a web browser, use `flutter run -d chrome` (ensure you have Chrome installed).
